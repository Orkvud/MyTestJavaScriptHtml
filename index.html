            <p>As any English-speaking child can tell you, there is no denying Dr. Seuss. If you love to read,
                but you’re a little afraid of reading a full-on novel in English, don’t worry.
                We’re going to help you get there, step by step. With every book you read, the more you’ll improve.
                To get started, there are some excellent novels written in English that are not too difficult
                to understand. Anyway, it’s good to set yourself a language challenge now and again.
                How else are you going to improve in English?</p>

            <h3>Reading is rewarding.</h3>

            <p data-meat="cc">Being able to read a novel in another language and understand it is a huge achievement.
                You’ll feel accomplished the moment you read that final page, close the book,
                and reflect on the experience. You might find yourself at the last page faster than you thought –
                once you begin reading these books, you won’t be able to put them down.</p>

            <h3>Reading is an exercise in language learning.</h3>

            <p data-meat="ccc">Reading English novels will help improve your vocabulary,
                general understanding and in some cases it may even give you more knowledge into different countries
                and their cultures. You also get to move at your own pace. While listening to podcasts and radio,
                you have to keep up with whoever is speaking. Sure, watching movies to learn English
                can be a lot of fun, but doesn’t it get tiring to have to read subtitles or pause and rewind?
                While reading a book, you can read as slowly or as quickly as you desire.
                If you didn’t understand something, simply look at the paragraph again!</p>

            <h3>Reading opens the mind.</h3>

            <p data-meat="ds cc">Reading educates. It opens you up to new experiences and perspectives.
                What better way is there to understand someone’s way of thinking?
                You may learn new information about  language, culture, society,
                and history that you never knew before.</p>

            <h3>Reading is fun!</h3>

            <p>It is, overall, an enjoyable and relaxing way to learn English without any stress whatsoever.
                People get frustrated when they choose books that go above their reading levels.
                By choosing your first English books wisely, you should have a very positive experience.<br>
